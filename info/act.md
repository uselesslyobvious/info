# How can I support the change?

## Contact your TDs

Educate yourself and spread the word. There's a lot of misinformation and fearmongering floating around. You can help by learning what the [new bill](2022-bill) actually means and giving information to others.

## Help civil rights organizations

There are many independent non-profit organizations already supporting the bill, some even actively participated in shaping it. You can join forces with them, or help them in any way you see fit.
