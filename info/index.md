# Hate speech affects all of us

Hate speech is a knife that can be weilded against any group of people. If you think that people you don't like deserve it - well, consider for a moment that there are other people who think you deserve it too.

But there are also a lot of people who believe that no one deserves to be treated like that. That hate speech ultimately serves the purpose of silencing others, making them fearful of speaking up, instead of having a productive conversation.

Unfortunately, at the moment our laws don't provide much protection against hate speech. Most of the time people who say that you should be deprived of something are getting away with it without any consequences. This needs to change.
