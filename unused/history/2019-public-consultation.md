# Public consultation

On 23 October 2019, the government launched a [public consultation on the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/089d38-ministers-flanagan-and-stanton-launch-consultation-on-hate-speech/).

Published submissions: https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/5743e-submissions-to-the-public-consultation-on-hate-crime-legislation/

Report: https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/1a62c-minister-mcentee-launches-findings-of-public-consultation-on-hate-speech-and-hate-crime-and-commits-to-drafting-new-legislation/

## Main findings

Copied from the report:

1. The 1989 Act is not effective in dealing with incitement to hatred and should
be replaced by a single piece of legislation to deal with both incitement to
hatred and hate crime.
2. The characteristics protected by the new legislation should include all of
those listed in the 1989 Act, and also gender, gender expression or identity,
and disability.
3. The definition of ‘ethnicity’ in the new legislation should explicitly
include membership of the Travelling Community on the same footing as other
ethnicities.
4. New offences of incitement to hatred are needed & should prohibit:
    1. deliberately or recklessly inciting hatred against a person or group of people
    due to their association with a protected characteristic, &,
    2. displaying or distributing material inciting hatred.
5. The new legislation should contain robust safeguards for freedom of
expression, such as protections for reasonable and genuine contributions to
literary, artistic, political, scientific or academic discourse, and fair and
accurate reporting.
6. Thresholds for criminal incitement to hatred should be high, for example
incitement to harm or unlawful discrimination. However, it should not be
necessary to show that anyone was actually influenced by the incitement or
persuaded to act upon it.
7. A company accused of displaying or distributing hateful material should be
able to defend itself by showing that it has reasonable measures in place to
prevent dissemination of this type of material in general, was complying with
those measures at the time and was unaware and had no reason to suspect that
this particular content was inciteful.
8. To be meaningful, the new legislation must also deal effectively with hate
crime. Threatening and abusive communications, criminal damage, harassment,
assault and intimidation are all common forms of hate crime as described by
participants in this consultation and specific, aggravated forms of existing
criminal offences should be included in the legislation to deal with these and
ensure that such crimes are properly categorised and recorded.
9. Additional elements may be needed to help ensure the new legislation is
effective, such as allowing alternative verdicts for juries where the
aggravating ‘hate’ element is not proven, and including a general provision (for
crimes that are not specific hate offences) to say that a judge will always
consider whether hate should be an aggravating factor in sentence, and where it
is, that this factor will be on the record.
10. Not every hate incident is serious enough to be a crime – many incidents are
better dealt with outside the criminal sphere and proper measures to ensure this
happens will be needed. In the long term, prevention of such incidents is the
most desirable outcome for all concerned. Success in this regard will depend
almost entirely on non-criminal, education and awareness-based measures.
