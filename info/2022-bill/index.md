# Criminal Justice (Incitement to Violence or Hatred and Hate Offences) Bill 2022

Link: https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2022/105/

## Short overview

:::info
This is not a legal advice, just a layman's understanding of the text. Quoted opinions of legal experts will be explicitly attributed to them.
:::

The bill introduces new offences:

* Section 7: communicating to public materials likely to incite violence or hatred
* Section 8: genocide denial
* Section 10: preparation or posession of materials likely to incite violence or hatred

Sections 7 and 10 require to prove that the person had the intent to incite violence or hatred, or was reckless about it. Section 8 omits the provision for recklessness, requiring the intent.

All three sections are affected by section 11: simply criticising something related to one of protected characteristics is not enough to be considered an offence.

Sections 7 and 10 further specifically allow for genuine contributions to discourse.
